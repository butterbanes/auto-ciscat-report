## Overview
This project was created during my time as an intern for the COH. I was inspired to make this program to ease the manual process of going through each and every section of a CISCAT Pro Assessor report and creating manually creating a Word document consisting of the section titles and their respective table data

    git clone https://github.com/butterbanes/auto-ciscat-report.git
